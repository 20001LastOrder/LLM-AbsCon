Description:
To confirm the start of delivery (4a), begin by simultaneously completing the following steps: adding missing Master Data, assigning Metering Services, and assigning Meter Operator. After that, notify the customer. Once the registration is confirmed, the process comes to an end.

Description:
In the beginning, the first step is to prepare the import documents. After that, the next step is to obtain the import license. Once the import license is obtained, the goods can be moved to the warehouse. At the same time, it is important to complete the following steps: inspecting the goods and making the necessary payment of duties and taxes. Once these steps are completed, the goods can be released, and that marks the end of the process.

Description:
To rent equipment, start by asking for the equipment. Then, check its availability. If the equipment is available, fill in the borrow form. If it's not available, the process ends. Once the borrow form is filled, sign it. Signing the borrow form requires accessing the data object "Borrow Form". After signing, you can borrow the equipment. If the borrow time ends, return the equipment. Returning the equipment requires checking if it's in good condition. If it is, write the return record. If not, quantify the damage. Writing the return record requires accessing the data object "Borrow Form". If there is any damage, pay for it. After paying, update the inventory. Updating the inventory requires accessing the data object "Inventory". Finally, write the return record and the process ends.

4. registration confirmed
The process specifies that activities 0, 1, 2 happen at the same time at the beginning, after which activity 3 should happen. Finally, the registration should be confirmed (activity 4). Thus, the final activity diagram should look like the following:
